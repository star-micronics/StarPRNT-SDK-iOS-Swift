# StarPRNT SDK iOS Swift

This package contains StarPRNT SDK for supporting to develop applications for Star printers.

In accordance with Apple's guidelines, StarIO V2.11.1 or later, StarIO_Extension V1.17.1 or later, StarIODeviceSetting V1.0.2 or later include a privacy manifest file.
Please see [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files) for the Manifest file.
StarIO, StarIO_Extension, uses User defaults APIs. StarIODeviceSetting does not use the Required Reason API. (As of January 29, 2024)


## Scope

Please refer to the [StarPRNT SDK document](https://www.star-m.jp/starprntsdk-oml-ios.html) for supported OS, development environment, and supported printers.


## Limitation
1. Notification in case of SM-L Series

    It could take some time when an iOS device tries to connect to a printer via "Bluetooth Low Energy".
    Refer to the "getPort API" section on the StarPRNT SDK document for details.

2. When using printer with Bluetooth Interface, please do not change the memory switch setting of "ASB Status" from default value(invalid). (Bank 7/Bit C)

3. In iOS 10.0 - 10.2.1 and 11.0 - 11.2.2, when using a Bluetooth printer, in rare cases, an error occurs when getPort, begin / endCheckedBlock is called, and thereafter the printer can not be discovered by the searchPrinter API. At this time, "Connected" is displayed in "Settings" - "Bluetooth", but the printer will not be displayed in "General" - "Information".

    [Restoration Method] Power off the printer once, or disconnect and reconnect Bluetooth from "Setting" app.

4. It has been reported that the following models go out of service after getting unable to be recognized by applications when "releasePort" is executed before all of a large volume data using "writePort" is completely sent to the printer:

    - SM-S210i (Firmware 3.1 or higher)
    - SM-S230i (Firmware 1.3)
    - SM-T300i (Firmware 3.1 or higher)
    - SM-T400i (Firmware 3.1 or higher)

    The following product also may lose Bluetooth connection in the same condition.

    - mPOP

    (the issue is already reported to Apple)

    StarPRNT SDK loops writePort until the data is completely sent in sendCommands method included in the Communication class but it is designed to make releasePort in case that it fails to send all the data within the designated time and in the result the above issue can happen.

    In order to eliminate the issue, please designate a proper length of time enough to complete the print data sending, if you prefer your application to make the above procedure.

    For your information, if the printer goes out of service, you can shut down the connection on the "Bluetooth" window of the setting screen and connect again, then the printer will come back.

    Even if Bluetooth loses connection, with the Auto Connection function enabled, the connection will be recovered automatically. Otherwise you will have to re-connect manually on the iOS "setting" window.

5. In iOS 11, set sleep to avoid a problem which sometimes cannot communicate with Bluetooth.
   Under our test environment, 0.2 sec sleep time is enough to avoid this problem.
   The appropriate sleep time is different depending on the environment.
   
   Please check under your own environment and set appropriate time for each environment.

6. Precaution related to compatibility

   Beginning from StarPRNT SDK v5.6.0, the readPort behavior when a LAN printer is used has been changed as shown below.
   When the data that should be received when readPort is executed does not exist

      - v5.5.0 and before: Throws a PortException.
      - v5.6.0 and later: Returns 0.

   If your application uses “Throws a PortException”, change it to “Returns 0”.

7. If mC-Sound was connected after the printer power was turned ON, melody speaker API does not work properly. Please turn on the printer after connecting mC-Sound to it.

8. For users of Ethernet/Wireless LAN interface with mC-Print2/3, TSP100LAN, and TSP100IIILAN/W:

   - To avoid a problem which sometimes fail getPort with Ethernet interface, the appropriate `portSettings` argument of getPort method is required.
   - Under our test environment, the setting of argument to `;l1000` can avoid this problem.
   - The appropriate argument is different depending on the environment.
   - Please check under your own environment and set the appropriate argument.
